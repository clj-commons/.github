# CLJ Commons

CLJ Commons is a community-led project to build up the supporting infrastructure around Clojure to make it a
better experience for people new to Clojure, as well as existing Clojurists.

## Current Goals
Adopt important Clojure libraries when the original maintainers no longer have the time or interest to keep them updated.
