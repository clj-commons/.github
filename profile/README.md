CLJ Commons is a community-led project to build up the supporting infrastructure around Clojure to make it a
better experience for people new to Clojure, as well as existing Clojurists.

## Current Goals
Adopt important Clojure libraries when the original maintainers no longer have the time or interest to keep them updated.

## Contributing
We have set up a [meta-repository](http://github.com/clj-commons/meta) where you can file issues for projects you want CLJ commons to adopt, or if you're interested in joining as a maintainer for a project that is dear to your heart.
 
Our meta-repository [README](https://github.com/clj-commons/meta/blob/master/README.md) discusses project entry and maintenance criteria,
and the repo also contains our general principles of [project governance](https://github.com/clj-commons/meta/blob/master/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md)
